# Baker-s-Bite
The Beginner's Baking Book

ABOUT THE APPLICATION
Baker’s Bite is a hobby based application that intends to be a digital baking book for beginner’s who want to bake without having to invest too much of their time and money figuring out how to.

Baker’s Bite provides a user-specific tailored knowledge hub of various bakes among the categories: Savory, Cakes, Bread, Pastry etc., which then open into respective recipes, ingredients’ lists, equipment, helpful videos and tips for baking. The application strives to instill a sense of baking community by allowing the users to share their recipes/experiences with other users of the platform and maintain a baking profile which reflects their activity on the application. In addition to this, Baker’s Bite connects its users to experts in the field of baking through the Meet the Experts section.

TARGETED USER GROUP
The potential users of Baker’s Bite belong to the age group of 24 to 36 years old, typically millennials who are busy with work and can dedicate a limited amount of time to baking. The users may or may not have prior experience with baking, the application is designed to cater to the needs of the users and make them comfortable with baking.

KEY FEATURES
Baker’s Bite is a hobby-based application that currently focuses on showcasing information about baking recipes in the following categories:
1. Bread and Biscuits
2. Cakes
3. Pastry
4. Savory
Each of the recipes have a video tutorial, the recipe in text and comments/feedback from users who have tried the recipe out.
Additionally, Baker’s Bite also hosts a page that allows its users to get to know some experts in the world of baking and learn more about their inspirational work. The application allows the user to create an account and maintain a baking profile by being able to share their own recipes on the platform. 

At present the application displays limited number of recipes under each category which is with the intention of showing the proof of concept of the project and can have a vast amount of information built into it over time. Figure2 depicts the layout of a sample recipe and showcases the feedback section available to the users to engage in discussion with regard to the recipe. The recipe pages contain a video tutorial of the bake along with the recipe in text. The comment section is associated with each recipe page and allows users to leave feedback or tips from their experience of trying the recipe out.

FUTURE WORK
Baker’s Bite can be enhanced further by constructing a backend mechanism that is able to handle the user accounts, user activities, remember the user’s preferences and perform successful screening of content according to the user’s profile. Having a backend integrated with the system will also help in storing and reproducing all the comments made in the recipes section along with the content of the blog which at present only lasts as long as the current session lasts. Additionally, with the help of machine learning algorithms, Baker’s Bite can be trained to suggest recipes to its users based on the user’s likes, search history and time commitments to baking. The application could also be made to reward its users in terms of Bake points for being active on the platform by providing feedback, posting videos of their recipes/their experience of trying a recipe out, participating in discussions on the Baker’s Blog etc. which could build a nice baker’s profile for the user on the system. In the interest of limited time available and required experience in the construction of backends for the development of Baker’s Bite these features have been categorized to be future work for the application.
